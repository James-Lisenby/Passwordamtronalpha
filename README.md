# Passwordamtronalpha is my first JavaScript based project. Using information from both class, and scouring the internet, I was able to put together the puzzle to finish the password generator. 
Once I finished the project (or so i thought) I realized that the generator was not using special characters or numbers.
After some trouble shooting, I found the error. Misspelled variable names in a few spots. 
Now after trouble shooting the generator works as intended.
